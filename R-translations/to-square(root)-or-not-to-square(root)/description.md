#To square(root) or not to square(root)

Write a function, that will get an integer vector as the parameter and will process every number from this vector.<br>
Return a new vector by processing every number of the input-array like this:<br>
```R
If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.

c(4,3,9,7,2,1) -> c(2,9,3,49,4,1)
```

The input vector will always contain only positive numbers and will never be NA or NULL.

The input vector should not be modified!
